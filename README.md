The totla number of employees who are about to retire is 90,398
Most of the employees who are about to retire are Senior Engeneers and Senior Staff
1,549 people are can participate in the mentorship program as mentors
There are more people retiring than there are potential mentors

## Summary

With so many people possibly retiring, how is the company going to replace that everyone without being affecting productivity or and possibly profitability?

One possible solution to this is figuring out how many people can immediately replace those who are about to retire and how many people can be mentored to fill some of the other positions. It is also important to look at the amount of positions that are going to be vacant and decide whether those positions are worth being filled and which ones are needed to start the hiring process to fill them up.

How is the mentoring program going to work with abot 90,000 people retiring and only 1,549 people being possible mentors?

We can add more mentors from the 90,000 employees that are about to retire by looking at when they are of age to retire. With this, we can consider those who are not going to immediately retire become mentors and add to the number of mentors.
